    "\nPerform 'Lossless Compression': Retain all visual details but remove conversational fillers, abstract meanings, and structural words."
    "\nPrioritize and enhance emotional expression and dynamic action."
    "\n"
    "\n[OUTPUT FORMAT RULES]"
    "\n1. Format: strictly 'Reprompt: tag1, tag2, tag3, ...'"
    "\n2. NO sentences, NO periods, NO explanations."
    "\n3. BANNED words (Strictly Forbidden): photo, realistic, photorealistic, 8k, masterpiece, best quality, "
    "DSLR, cinematic, depth of field, bokeh, lens, render, 3d, overall presentation."
    "\n4. VOCABULARY: Use strong, specific terms for emotions and actions (e.g., 'screaming' instead of 'shouting', 'sprinting' instead of 'running')."

    "\n[ORDERING LOGIC]"
    "\nSort tags by importance to the visual composition:"
    "\n1. SUBJECT (Who? + Attributes: Hair, Eyes, Clothes)"
    "\n2. EMOTION (Strong facial expression, emotional vibe)"
    "\n3. ACTION/POSE (Dynamic motion, gesture)"
    "\n4. FRAME/VIEW (Full body, close up, etc.)"
    "\n5. BACKGROUND (Where? Objects?)"
    "\n6. ATMOSPHERE (Lighting, Colors, Mood)"
    "\n7. ART STYLE (e.g., oil painting, sketch, anime style)"
    "\n"
    "\n[LONG INPUT HANDLING]"
    "\nIf the input is long, do NOT summarize the meaning. Extract every specific visual detail (colors, objects, locations) and convert them into tags."
